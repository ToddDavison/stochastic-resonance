### CORRECTIONs for Abhi's Work
1. Revisit milstein process again, there are some incorrect terms.
2. revisit the scaling for noise term.
3. Find exact solution for the langevin equation.
    formal solution ornstein-uhlebleck processes (same as langevin kindof)

## Next Steps
Find temperature data for the earth (not necessary but it would be nice)
- could do statistical analysis on the data
- find out some kind of period
- having this data would open up several avenues

Monte-Carlo
- simulate a lot and take the average at the end to get the expectation.

Different ways to visualise results 
- through monte-carlo for example
- simulate a bunch of paths and show the reader
- simulate a bunch of paths and do analysis on their paths.

Calculate probabilities
- likeliness to being in warm age vs cold age

Take a look at implementing climate resonance paper's SDE.
